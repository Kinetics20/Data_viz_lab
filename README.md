# 📊 Data Visualisation Practice with Matplotlib and Seaborn

This repository is a personal learning space where I explore and practice **data analysis** and **data visualization** using Python libraries such as [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/).

## 🔍 Purpose

The main goal of this project is to:
- Learn how to create different types of plots and charts  
- Understand how to visualize relationships in data  
- Practice customizing visualizations for better insight and clarity

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python 3.13.1  
- JupyterLab  
- Seaborn  
- Matplotlib  


## 🧪 Examples of Visualizations

- Line plots, bar charts, and histograms  
- Scatter plots and pair plots  
- Heatmaps and correlation matrices  
- Custom styles, themes, and color palettes

All visualizations are created in **Jupyter Notebook** format and run in a **JupyterLab** environment for interactive and visual data exploration.
